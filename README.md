# projection_extremes

The code is based on the study of extremal dependence via Euclidean projections, developed by Meyer and Wintenberger (2020).

Three numerical results are provided.
The first one deals with asymptotically independent data, the second one with dependent data. We compare our approach to the one introduced by Goix et al (2017).
The third example illustrates how to use the vector Z which arises as the limit of the angular component of a sparsely regularly varying random vector.
