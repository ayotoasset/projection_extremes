# projection_extremes

The code is based on the study of extremal dependence through L^1 minimization, developed by Meyer and Wintenberger (2019).

Two numerical results are provided. THe first one deals with asymptotically independent data, the second one with dependent data. We compare our approach to the one developed by Goix et al (2017).
